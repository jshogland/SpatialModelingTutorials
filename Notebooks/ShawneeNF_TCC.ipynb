    "# Percent Tree Canopy Cover Notebook\n",
    "## In this notebook we will explore how to build a simple random sample of point locations, extract remotely sensed data for those locations, and use that data to estimate % Tree Cover for the Shawnee National Forest.\n",

    "### Project objective:\n",
    "- Build a machine learning model from estimates of 2016 percent forest canopy cover, elevation data, and Landsat 8 imagery for that same time period\n",
    "- Apply that model to elevation and Landsat 8 data acquired in 2021 to estimate percent forest canopy cover in 2021\n",
    "- Compare our model estimates to [MLRC](https://www.mrlc.gov/data-services-page) % forest canopy cover estimates for the year 2021\n",

Depending on the type of data (categorical or continuous), we have multiple options when it comes to standardization, scaling, normalization, and encoding [SciKit Learn Preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#). For example, one can normalize continuous data to have zero mean and unit variance or they can simply scale values to a range between 0 and 1. Likewise, many modeling techniques require categorical variables to be encoded in a special manner (e.g., One Hot Encoder). In this step we will demonstrate how to scale our Landsat and elevation values between 0 and 1 and use the One Hot Encoder method to encode our red_cat variable.\n"

This situation can be problematic for many modeling techniques. To address this situation, analyst will attempt to transform their data using one of many common [transformations](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/data_transforms.html).

Additionally, it can be used to reduce the dimensionality of data and or project the data to highlight various aspects of the data. \n",

    "##### Step 3: Interpolating results (no extrapolation)\n",
    "\n",
    "One import issue that is often overlooked when applying models to new observations is determining when a model is interpolating vs extrapolating. So what does this mean? First, let's define these two cases. Interpolating means that predictions are made for new observations in which the predictor values fall within the range of values used to train the model. While, extrapolation occurs when the predictor values used to estimate the new observation fall outside of the range used to calibrate the model. In all cases interpolated estimates are preferred to extrapolated estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "This issue is also closely related to the number of variables used to train a model and the model's ability to be generalized to the population. Generally, this means that as you increase the number of variables used in a model, you also need to increase the number of observation used to train the model to insure capturing the range of all potential predictor variable values (domain). This situation is often referred to as the curse of dimensionality. Can you think of other issues associated with increasing the number of predictor variables used in a model? \n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a sample or training set, special effort should be made to insure your sample is well spread and balanced to the naturally occurring distribution of the population. Additionally, once a model has been built it is always a good idea to define the range in which estimates are being interpolated vs extrapolating. To do this let's assume we will be using all predictor variables. Using our training dataframe we can build a simple model that queries all cells within our predictor image that fall within the range of sampled values using the values returned from describing our data. This new raster surface can then be used as a mask that spatially describes where the model is interpolating values.   "

    "##### Step 4: Estimating error at the cell level\n",
    "So far we have created multiple models using our training sample, evaluated the overall accuracy and fit of our models (fit statistics), applied our models back to our imagery, and have determined a spatial mask that defines where (which cells) we are interpolating estimates as opposed to extrapolating estimates. However, we have not directly discussed how to spatially describe estimation error. While this has less applicability for our clustering model (each cluster has a mean and the variation around that mean (distance) is used to assign observations to a given cluster), for regression and classification models, estimation error is important to describe. That is, each estimate we make for each cell in our image is a mean estimate. That mean estimate has variation which we can use to calculate the standard error of that estimate and/or a confidence interval. To calculate standard error for each estimate we can employee two broad techniques; 1) use classical statistical distributions to estimate standard error or 2) empirically derive estimates of standard error using bootstrapping. To demonstrate how to calculate standard error for our TCC regression and our forest density models we will employee a bootstrapping and classical distribution approach, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, let's look at the TCC regression model. Remember that this model is an ensemble of CART models and that each CART model is derived from a random subset of our training data that selects observations at random with replacement. For new observations, each CART model is used to estimate a mean for each observation in our new dataframe of observations. These mean values are then averaged to determine a overall mean value for that observation. This overall mean value is the estimate applied to each raster cell in our previous TCC image. To calculate standard error for each image cell using bootstrapping, we simply need to calculate the standard deviation of each CART model estimate for that cell.  "

    "Now let's calculate standard error for Nnet classification of forest density. In this case we only have one Nnet. We could employee a similar strategy as with the random forest model if we used bagging and developed many Nnets for subsets of the training data but that would require making a new type of of model, a ensemble of Nnets. Instead, let's assume a multinomial distribution of our data and use basic statistical properties. To do this we need to recognize that our classification is really a rule based on the probability that each class is present at each cell, given our predictor variable input. The rule used to turn probabilities to a given label is very simple. The class with the largest probability get the corresponding label. In this case we really are not as interested with the rule as much as the probabilities and the error associated with the class probabilities. That means we will be estimating standard error for each class probability estimate. For a multinomial distribution, standard error can be approximated as a function of the probability:\n",
